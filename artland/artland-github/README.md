There are some differences with original assignments and features:
1. Users in search form loads by chunks of 10 items. Next 10 could be added if the last user reached in users section
by scrolling right.
2. I didn't find how to load repositories with offset (as expected according to GraphQL guides) and I implemented
'light' version with Load more repositories ability.
